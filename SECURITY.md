# Security policy

## Security and trust

WindowsGSH modules execute with the same Windows permissions as the WindowsGSH application. WindowsGSH cannot review, sign, or guarantee arbitrary third-party modules, so only run module code you trust.

## Download modules safely

Obtain this module from the official [WindowsGSH.DontStarveTogether repository](https://github.com/WindowsGSH/WindowsGSH.DontStarveTogether) or another source you have independently verified. Review the module source and manifest before importing it, and be cautious of repackaged downloads or unexpected executable files.

## Protect credentials and server data

The Klei cluster token, cluster password, server configuration, worlds, logs, and backups may contain sensitive information. Klei requires the token in `cluster_token.txt`; restrict access to the server and backup directories and never publish that file. Do not include tokens, passwords, private addresses, or unredacted archives in issues or diagnostics.

## Report a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for an unpatched vulnerability or exposed credential. Use GitHub's private security-reporting facility for this repository where available, or contact the WindowsGSH maintainers privately before disclosure.

## Include in a report

Include the affected module and WindowsGSH versions, a clear description, reproduction steps, impact, relevant sanitized logs, and any proposed mitigation. Remove all credentials, tokens, personal paths, and server data.

## Supported versions

Only the current module release receives security fixes unless a repository notice explicitly states otherwise. Upgrade to the latest supported WindowsGSH and module versions before reporting an issue.
